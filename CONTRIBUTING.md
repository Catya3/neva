# Requirements

Make sure you've read the https://nevalang.org/docs from cover to cover

## System

- Go: https://go.dev/doc/install
- Make: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/#download
- NodeJS and NPM: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm/
- Antlr: `pip install antlr4-tools`
- Tygo: `go install github.com/gzuidhof/tygo@latest`

## VSCode

These are not really required but recommended in order you're using VSCode

- [nevalang](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nevalang.vscode-nevalang)
- [antlr4](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mike-lischke.vscode-antlr4)
- [tmlanguage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pedro-w.tmlanguage)
- [markdown-mermaid](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid)

# Development

See [architecture high level overview](./ARCHITECTURE.md) and what [Makefile](./Makefile) can do.

## VSCode Extension

Extension depends on types defined in the `src` and `typesystem` packages so it's dangerous to rename those. If you going to do so, make sure you did't brake TS types generation.

Check out [tygo.yaml](./tygo.yaml). and CONTRIBUTING.md in vscode-neva repo.

## ANTLR Grammar

Don't forget to open `neva.g4` file before debugging with VSCode

# Naming conventions

## Tests

Use `_` instead of space in for test-case names because go turns spaces into underscores and makes it hard to find specific case.
