# Requirements

## System

## VSCode

These are not really required but recommended in order you're using VSCode

- [nevalang](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nevalang.vscode-nevalang)
- [antlr4](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mike-lischke.vscode-antlr4)
- [tmlanguage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pedro-w.tmlanguage)
- [tooltitude](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tooltitudeteam.tooltitude)
- [markdown-mermaid](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid)
- [ts-errors](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yoavbls.pretty-ts-errors)
- [vscode-protolint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Plex.vscode-protolint)

# Development

First read the [language specification](docs/spec.md), [design document](./ARCHITECTURE.md) and see what can [Makefile](./Makefile) do.

Remember that many go packages contain [doc comments](https://tip.golang.org/doc/comment). Do not fear to read the source code, leave the comments for unintuitive parts.

Try to follow [clean code](https://github.com/Pungyeon/clean-go-article) and [clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) best practices in general. Follow [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID).

Discuss your idea via github discussions or issues before implementing it. Write tests, avoid using `nolint`. Leave the comments (but only when you have to), update documentation.

## Github Issues

Issues must only be created for known bugs and understandable architecture issues. Not ideas, suggestions or feature requests. Discussions must be used for that instead.

## VSCode Extension

Check out [tygo.yaml](./tygo.yaml). It depends on types defined in the `src` and `typesystem` packages and thus it's dangerous to rename those types. If you gonna do so make sure you don't brake TS types generation. Check [web/CONTRIBUTING.md](./web/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## ANTLR Grammar

Don't forget to open `neva.g4` file before debugging with VSCode!

# Naming conventions

## Tests

Use `_` instead of space in for test-case names because go turns spaces into underscores and makes it hard to find specific case.
