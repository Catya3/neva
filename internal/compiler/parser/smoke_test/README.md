# Smoke Tests

This directory contains smoke tests for code generated by ANTLR from `neva.g4` file.

These tests generally needed to debug ANTLR grammar. They are especially helpful in conjunction with VSCode's ANTLR debugger. If you got you need to debug _grammar_ (not parser itself) you should use these smoke tests.

You may find unit-tests for parser and parser's listener helpers in the `parser` directory.
