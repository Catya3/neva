**<p align="center">Flow Based Programming Language</p>**

# Neva (Proof of Concept)

A general-purpose flow-based programming language with static types and implicit parallelism. Compiles to machine code and Go.

Website: https://nevalang.org/

> ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This project is under heavy development and **not production ready** yet.

## Hello World

Nevalang programs are executable dataflow graphs. Execution starts with the single `start` message and ends after first `stop` message.

```neva
component Main(start any) (stop any) {
	nodes { printer Printer<string> }
	net {
		:start -> ('Hello, World!' -> printer:data)
		printer:sig -> :stop
	}
}
```

When `Main` receives a `:start` signal, it sends a `'Hello, World!'` message to `data` inport of the node `printer`, which is an instance of a `Printer` component. Then `printer` sends a signal to it's `sig` outport and we use that as a signal to our `:stop` outport.

## Features üöÄ

- Flow-Based Programming
- Implicit Parallelism
- Strong Static Typing
- Multi-Target Compilation
- Clean C-like Syntax
- Interpreter Mode
- Builtin Dependency Injection
- Builtin Observability
- Garbage Collection

Please note that even though these features are technically implemented, **developer-experience could be very bad** due to current project state which is pre-MVP.

### Roadmap (üöß WIP)

Nevalang is at extrimely early stage but with the help of community it can become feature-reach mature langauge.

- Building a Community
- Core Standard Library
- Feature-Rich LSP-compatible Language Server
- Go Interop (import go from neva, import neva from go)
- DAP-compatible Debugger
- No Runtime Exceptions (If it runs then it works)
- Visual Programming in VSCode (Nevalang becomes hybrid langauge)

Nevalang needs **your** help - it only have one maintainer.
