# Neva

A general-purpose, flow-based programming language with static typing and implicit parallelism, designed with visual programming in mind, that compiles to machine code and Go.

```neva
component Main(start any) (stop any) {
	nodes { printer Printer<string> }
	net {
		in:start -> ('Hello, World!' -> printer:msg)
		printer:msg -> out:stop
	}
}
```
