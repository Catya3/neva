# Rules

0. Runtime runs programs
1. Compiler creates programs from source code packages
2. Source code package is generated by client or written by hand

# Module validation rules

1. Module must have `in` and `out` with at least 1 port each
2. There must be no `Unknown` among port types
3. There must be `net` defining connections
4. There could be `workers` defing network's worker nodes
5. If there are `workers` then there must be also `deps` defining dependencies
6. Any `worker` must point to defined `dep`
7. Any `dep` must have valid `in` and `out` defined
8. There could be `const` defining constant values

## Checking network

9.  There must be no `deps` unused in `workers`
10. There must be no `worker` or `const` not used by `net`
