# Standart Library

## Builtins

Builtins are special subset of entities in a standard library that are available in local namespace of any package through implicit imports. It's possible, however, to explicitly import or shadow builtin entity. Builtins are the only requirements from standard library described in specification and they are the only entities that can be implicitly imported.  There's 4 types of package entity and all of them represented as builtins. Each of them has its own page in this specification:

- [Types](type.md)
- [Messages](msg.md)
- [Interfaces](io.md)
- [Components](component.md)
