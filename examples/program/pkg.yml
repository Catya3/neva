# there are 2 kinds of descriptors
# 1 - have root and no export
# 2 - don't have root and do have export
# first are library-packages, second - executable programs
# in both cases we're dealing with packages
# package in a nutshell is set of components (with the name of the root sometimes)
# its like main package in go - it can't have exported members
# and it's the only one package that can be compiled to binary
