// We gonna add some state now.
// Remember how we started over when something was wrong?
// It's time to make our calculator a little bit more user-friendly!
// Now instead of starting everything over we just rollback to the last step.
// Example: if user choose operation correctly but inserted invalid number
// we don't force him to choose operation again. We only ask him to type number
// again. Same goes for second number. We only start over when operation is
// invalid.
