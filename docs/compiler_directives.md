# Compiler Directives

- `runtime_func` - directive for _component_ that tells the compiler that given component does not have implementation in source code and instead a runtime function call must be created.
- `runtime_func_msg` - Directive for _node_ that tells the compiler to insert given message to corresponding runtime function call. Can only be used with nodes that are instantiated with components with `runtime_func` directive.
