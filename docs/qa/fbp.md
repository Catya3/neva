# FBP

## Is Neva "classical FBP"?

No. But it inherits so many ideas from it that it would be better to use word "FBP" than anything else. There's a [great article](https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/fbp-inspired-vs-real-fbp.html) by mr. J. Paul Morrison (inventor of FBP) on this topic.

Now here's what makes Neva different from classical FBP:

- Neva has C-like syntax for its textual representation while FBP syntax is somewhat esoteric. It's important to node though that despite C-like syntax Neva programs are 100% declarative
- Neva doesn't let you program in "implementation-level" language like Go (similar to how Python doesn't let you program in assembly). FBP on the other hand forces you to program in langauges like Go or Java to implement elementary components.
- Neva introduces builtin observability via runtime interceptor and messages tracing, FBP has nothing like that
- Existing FBP implementations are essentially interpreters. Neva has both compiler and interpreter.
- Neva is statically typed while FBP isn't. FBP's idea is that you write code by hand in statically typed langauge like Go or Java and then use it in a non-typed FBP program, introducing runtime type-checks where needed
- Neva have _runtime functions_. In FBP there's just _elementary components_ that are written by programmer. Mr. Morrison did not like the idea of having "atomic" components like e.g. "numbers adder"
- Neva introduces hierarchical structure of program entities and package management similar to Go. Entities are packed into reusable packages and could be either public or private.
- Neva leverages existing Go's GC, FBP on the other hand introduces IP's life-cycle
- Neva's concurrency model runs on top of Go's scheduler which means it uses CSP as a lower-level fundament. FBP implementations on the other hand used to use shared state with mutex locks
- Neva has low-level program representation (LLR). FBP on the other hand doesn't describe anything like that

Also there's differences in naming:

- _Message_ instead of _IP (information package)_ not to be confused with "IP" as _internet protocol_
- _Node_ instead of _process_ 1) not to be confused with _OS processes_
- _Bound inports_ instead of _IIPs_ because of not using word _IP_
