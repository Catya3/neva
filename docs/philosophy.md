# Philosophy

Balance between _efficiency_, _performance_ and _safety_.

## (Developer) Efficiency

Developer must be able to implement the feature as fast as possible.

## (Machine) Performance

Computer must be able to execute the program as fast as possible.

## (Program) Safety

The system must protect the developer from making mistakes.
